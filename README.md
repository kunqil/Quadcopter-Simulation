<ul>
  <li>This project makes a simulation of quadcopter using MATLAB by capturing its six degrees of freedom along the X, Y, Z axis for linear and angular velocities. 
  <li>This project's tehc stack is matlab, using a model-based design methodology.
  <li>This project is a homework project of ECPS202 Cyber-physical system design in University of California, Irvine.
  <li>All of these materias are given by class, If any reference is needed, please contact me.
